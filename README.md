I have developed a backend for a blog website from scratch using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt, Morgan, and Yup technologies. The website includes features such as registration and login pages, as well as functionalities for creating, deleting, and updating blog posts. Initially, blog posts are saved as drafts and are only visible to the owner. However, the owner has the option to make their blog post public for others to see.

The website's architecture is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the backend. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for data storage, and Mongoose is used as an Object Document Mapper (ODM) to facilitate communication between the Node.js server and the MongoDB database.

To ensure secure authentication, JWT and Bcrypt are utilized for token-based authentication and password hashing, respectively. Morgan and Winston are used for logging purposes, providing a detailed record of each request made to the server. Yup is used for validation, ensuring that all data received by the server is in the correct format and meets the specified criteria.

Overall, this blog website's backend provides a seamless and secure experience for users to create, manage, and share their blog posts with the world.
